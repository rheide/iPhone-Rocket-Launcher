Use your iPhone to connect to and control a USB rocket launcher

Contains two examples of using the iPhone to connect to a Rocket launcher server and control the rocket launcher remotely. 

Rock - Control the launcher with buttons
Very basic app, doesn't support multiple actions at the same time (eg. down-left or up-right). 

Rock2 - Control the launcher with the accelerometer
Tilt the iPhone left/right (like changing orientation from portrait to landscape) to rotate the rocket launcher, and tilt it to control the up/down movement. This app doesn't support firing yet.
